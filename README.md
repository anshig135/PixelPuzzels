# PixelPuzzles – An Interactive Pattern Matching Game 🎮🧠

**PixelPuzzles** is a hardware-based, interactive pattern matching game designed to enhance cognitive and visual processing skills. Developed as our final-year engineering project, this system integrates **embedded systems**, **custom PCB design**, and **interactive logic algorithms** to create a versatile tool for **learning and cognitive development**.

## 💡 Project Overview

PixelPuzzles challenges users to replicate random LED patterns using tactile push buttons. The game provides real-time feedback through visual and auditory cues, making it both engaging and educational.

### Key Features

- 🔲 **8x8 LED Matrix Display** powered by MAX7219 ICs for dynamic pattern visualization
- 🎮 **Push-button interface** for user pattern input
- 🎛️ **Microcontroller-based logic** (Arduino) for real-time control and feedback
- 🛠️ **Custom-designed PCB** for compact and efficient hardware integration
- 📢 **Buzzer and LCD feedback system** for user interaction cues
- 🔄 **Pattern comparison logic** to validate user input and give feedback

## 📦 Components Used

- Arduino Uno R3 / Nano
- 2 x 8x8 LED Matrix displays (with MAX7219 drivers)
- Push buttons (for directional control + pattern submission)
- LCD Display (16x2)
- Buzzer
- Custom PCB
- Resistors, jumper wires, and connectors
- Power supply module

## 🧠 Applications

- **Cognitive Skill Development**: Enhances memory, visual processing, and spatial recognition
- **Educational Use**: Ideal for classroom use to help children improve focus and logical thinking
- **Special Education Support**: Structured play to assist children with developmental delays or cognitive impairments

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Random Pattern Generation**: A unique shape is generated on the first LED matrix.
2. **User Interaction**: Players recreate the pattern using push buttons on the second matrix.
3. **Pattern Comparison**: Upon pressing the "Compare" button, the system checks if the user’s pattern matches the generated one.
4. **Feedback**: The system gives audio (buzzer) and visual (LCD message) feedback on whether the pattern matches.
